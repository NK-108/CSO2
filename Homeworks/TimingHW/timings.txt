Used while loop structure to test process until total duration exceeded half a second for all scenarios. 
Calculated overhead as single interation and incrementation through while loop, with dummy arithmetic where appropriate.
Found overhead value of approximately 175 ns.

Scenario 1: 
- Overhead: 38 ns 
- Duration: -16 ns

Scenario 2: 
- Overhead: 44 ns
- Duration: 72 ns

Scenario 3:
- Overhead: 34 ns
- Duration: 3168833 ns

Scenario 4:
- Overhead: 36 ns
- Duration: 967 ns

Scenario 5:
- Overhead: 39 ns
- Duration: 12262 ns
