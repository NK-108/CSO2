Used while loop structure to test process until total duration exceeded half a second for all scenarios. 
Calculated overhead as single interation and incrementation through while loop, with dummy arithmetic where appropriate.
Found overhead value of approximately 175 ns.

Scenario 1: 
- No Overhead Correction: 28 ns
- Overhead Correction: -150 ns
Scenario 2: 
- No Overhead Correction: 602 ns
- Overhead Correction: 435 ns
Scenario 3:
- No Overhead Correction: 1449067 ns
- Overhead Correction: 1448887 ns
Scenario 4:
- No Overhead Correction: 2611 ns
- Overhead Correction: 2435 ns
Scenario 5: 
- No Overhead Correction: 3101 ns
- Overhead Correction: 2926 ns
